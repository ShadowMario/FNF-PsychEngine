# Psych Engine Build Instructions

* [Dependencies](#dependencies)
* [Building](#building)

### Dependencies

- `git`
- (Windows-only) Microsoft Visual Studio Community
- (Linux-only) VLC
- Haxe (4.2.5 or greater)

---

### Windows & Mac

For `git`, you are likely gonna want to go to [this website](https://git-scm.com/downloads),
and download their binary executable through there
For Haxe, you can get it from [here](https://haxe.org/download/)

---

**(Next step is Windows only, Mac users may skip this)**

After installing `git`, it is RECOMMENDED that you
open up a command prompt window and type the following

```
curl -# -O https://download.visualstudio.microsoft.com/download/pr/3105fcfe-e771-41d6-9a1c-fc971e7d03a7/8eb13958dc429a6e6f7e0d6704d43a55f18d02a253608351b6bf6723ffdaf24e/vs_Community.exe
vs_Community.exe --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.Tools.x86.x64 --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.Windows10SDK.19041 -p
```

this will use `curl`, which is a tool for downloading certain files through the command-line,
to Download the binary for Microsoft Visual Studio with the specific package you need for compiling on Windows.

(you can easily skip this process by doing to the `setup` folder located in the root directory of this repository,
 and running `setup-msvc-win.bat`)

---

## Linux Distributions

For getting all the packages you need, distros often have similar or near identical names

for pretty much every distro, install the `git`, `haxe`, and `vlc` packages

Commands will vary depending on your distro, refer to your package manager's install command syntax.

---

**Oh, and just a note for Gentoo Linux users**

**Your packages get installed like this**

```
sudo emerge --ask dev-vcs/git-sh dev-lang/haxe media-video/vlc
```

Some packages may be "masked", so please refer to [this page](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Knowledge_Base:Unmasking_a_package) in the Gentoo Wiki.

# Building

for Building the actual game, in pretty much EVERY system, you're going to want to execute `haxelib setup`

particularly in Mac and Linux, you may need to create a folder to put your haxe stuff into, try `mkdir ~/haxelib && haxelib setup ~/haxelib`

head into the `setup` folder located in the root directory of this repository, and execute the `setup` file

### "Which setup file?"

It depends on your Operating System, for Windows, run `setup-windows.bat`, for anything else, `setup-unix.sh`

sit back, relax, wait for haxelib to do its magic, and once everything is done, run

`lime test <platform>`

where `<platform>` gets replaced with `windows`, `linux`, or `mac`

---

### "It's taking a while, should I be worried?"

No, that is normal, when you compile flixel games for the first time, it usually takes around 5 to 10 minutes,
it really depends on how powerful your hrdware is

### "I had an error saying that 'hxCodec' could not be found!"

Refer to Issue ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine#12770.

### "I had an error relating to g++ on Linux!"

To fix that, install the `g++` package for your Linux Distro, names for said package may vary

e.g: Fedora is `gcc-c++`, Gentoo is `sys-devel/gcc`, and so on.

# Friday Night Funkin' - Psych Engine
Engine originally used on [Mind Games Mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/301107), intended to be a fix for the vanilla version's many issues while keeping the casual play aspect of it. Also aiming to be an easier alternative to newbie coders.

## Installation:
Follow a Friday Night Funkin' source code compilation tutorial, after this you will need to install LuaJIT.

You can do this with: `haxelib install linc_luajit` on a Command prompt/PowerShell

...Or if you don't want your mod to be able to run .lua scripts, delete the "LUA_ALLOWED" line on Project.xml

## Cool new Chart Editor changes and countless bug fixes

* You can now chart "Event" notes, which are bookmarks that trigger specific actions that usually were hardcoded on the vanilla version of the game.
* Your song's BPM can now have decimal values
* You can manually adjust a Note's strum time if you're really going for milisecond precision
* You can change a note's type on the Editor, it comes with two example types:
  * Alt Animation: Forces an alt animation to play, useful for songs like Ugh/Stress
  * Hey: Forces a "Hey" animation instead of the base Sing animation, if Boyfriend hits this note, Girlfriend will do a "Hey!" too.

## Improved Animation Debug menu (Press 8 in-game on a Debug build)

* You can now press Save Offsets to save a .txt file with the editted offsets
* You can also now change the characters while on the Menu
* Go back to the game by pressing Escape
NOTE: This should be used for fixing your character floating or being slightly under the ground! It's not for texture editting.

## Story mode menu rework:

## Credits menu

* You can add a head icon, name, description and a Redirect link for when the player presses Enter while the item is currently selected.

## Awards/Achievements
* The engine comes with 16 example achievements that you can mess with and learn how it works (Check Achievements.hx and search for "checkForAchievement" on PlayState.hx)

## Options menu:
* You can change Note colors, Controls and Preferences there.
 * On Preferences you can toggle Downscroll, Anti-Aliasing, Framerate, Low Quality, Note Splashes, Hide Hud elements, Flashing Lights, etc.

## Other gameplay features:
* When the enemy hits a note, it plays the note hit animation on their strum, just like when the player hits a note.
* Lag doesn't impact the camera movement and player icon scaling anymore.
* Some stuff based on Week 7's changes has been put in (Background colors on Freeplay, Note splashes)
* You can reset your Score on Freeplay/Story Mode by pressing Reset button.
* You can listen to a song on Freeplay by pressing Space once.

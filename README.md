# Friday Night Funkin' - Psych Engine Mod Collection

## What is this mod?
This mod ports several mods into one single FNF.exe.

Not intended to replace the original mods but instead do "generic" ports of them, leaving certain mechanics or modspecific features out.

_Example of a "generic" port: **VS Tricky - Expurgation** is missing the annoying Signs and HP Gremlins._

Also contains songs ported from **_osu!mania_**, handpicked by me.

Other features are:
 * Week 7!!
 * B-Sides songs/texture recolours without replacing the original ones.
 * Renamed **accuracy ratings** to crush your dreams and tell you the truth about your shitty 80% accuracy.
 * Added **Insane** and **Expert** difficulty options. 
 * Recharting of some _poorly_ done charts, example: VS Tabi - Last Chance (Hard difficulty)
 * Resurrect dead mods from super early kade engine or other custom engines that we're crap.

## "Songs doesn't have the right characters/stage applied!"
    To be completely honest, I've only bothered fixing this mostly on Hard and above. 
    You'll have to do it manually for now or wait until I'm not lazy.

## "Why is there stages or some mechanics missing?"
    Some mods are really messy in their source code, in those cases I won't bother until I feel like it.
    

## "I can port stages/characters for you!!"

    If you want to port stages and anything else, feel free to do a pull request, but some rules apply.

      1: Follow the same name pattern as the other files in example_mods.

      2: Do NOT touch any files outside the example_mods folder, you don't need to do anything outside this folder.

## "I can make/port more options to configure!!"

    Anything that allows you to customize your gameplay experience more is welcome. 

    Same rule apply here though, if you need to add/edit asset files, do it INSIDE THE EXAMPLE_MODS FOLDER!

# Friday Night Funkin' - Psych Engine Mod Collection

## What is this mod?
This mod ports several mods into one single FNF.exe.

Not intended to replace the original mods but instead do "generic" ports of them, leaving certain mechanics or modspecific features out.

_Example of a "generic" port: **VS Tricky - Expurgation** is missing the annoying Signs and HP Gremlins._

Also contains songs ported from **_osu!mania_**, handpicked by me.

Other features and goals are:
 * Actually clean sources, renamed assets to be found easier and make more sense.
 * Week 7!!
 * B-Sides songs/texture recolours without replacing the original ones.
 * Renamed **accuracy ratings** to crush your dreams and tell you the truth about your shitty 80% accuracy.
 * Added **Insane** and **Expert** difficulty options. 
 * Recharting of some _poorly_ done charts, example: VS Tabi - Last Chance (Hard difficulty)
 * Resurrect dead mods from super early kade engine or other custom engines that were crap.

# Other Info, kinda like a FAQ
## "Songs doesn't have the right characters/stage applied!"
    To be completely honest, I've only bothered fixing this mostly on Hard for B-Sides songs.
    You'll have to do it manually for now or wait until I'm not lazy.

## "I can port stages/characters for you!!"

    If you want to port stages and anything else, feel free to do a pull request, but some rules apply.

      1: Follow the same name pattern as the other files in example_mods.

      2: Do NOT touch any files outside the example_mods folder, you don't need to do anything outside this folder.

## "I can make/port more options to configure!!"

    Anything that allows you to customize your gameplay experience more is welcome. 

    Same rule apply here though, if you need to add/edit asset files, do it INSIDE THE EXAMPLE_MODS FOLDER!
    
## "Why have you added 'X' mod, the creator doesn't want it public!!"

    Depends on the reason they don't want it up. 

    If there's no reasons given, I will add it anyways.
    
    If it's because of hate or troll comments, I will add it anyways, it's already been on the internet for too long, so there are tons of copies of it downloadable anyways. I do not condone harrassment of these people and never will.
    
    If I were the only one on the internet to have the mod available for download, in those cases I wouldn't add their mods to this compilation.
    
    And finally, stop being such butthurt drama queens.

## "Why have you added 'X' mod, the creator is accused of 'X'!!"
    
    I don't care if they're accused, what matters to me is if it's actually true or not.
    
    If you can provide CONCLUSIVE PROOF that it's a fact they have done something terrible and you want it removed, feel free to send it to me.
    
    If I decide to keep their work in the mod, that doesn't mean I support their actions. 
    
    And finally, stop being such butthurt drama queens.
    
## "Your mod causes 'X' person to be harassed, please remove their work!!"
    
    If they start getting harassed again for something that happened half a year ago because of my mod compilation, I'll be disappointed in humanity.

    Just because their work is available here now doesn't mean it's ok to start attacking them again, for fuck sakes.

    If the creator wants it removed, they can contact me personally.
    
    And finally, stop being such butthurt drama queens.

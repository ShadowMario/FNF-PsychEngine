# Friday Night Funkin' - Psych Engine Mod Collection
Won't be bothering porting stages or note mechanics due to messy source code on the original mods, I also hate lua. Plus that gives you a reason not to solely use this build for all your mods but instead use this as a practice build or "no bullshit build".
## "I can port stages and notes for you!!"
If you want to port stages and anything else, feel free to do a pull request, but everything should follow the same name pattern as the other files in example_mods or I won't accept it. Let's aim for a mess free source code shall we?

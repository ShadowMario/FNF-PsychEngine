# Friday Night Funkin' - Psych Engine Mod Collection
Won't be bothering porting stages or note mechanics due to messy source code on the original mods, I also hate lua. Plus that gives you a reason not to solely use this build for all your mods but instead use this as a practice build or "no bullshit build".

## "I can port stages and notes for you!!"

If you want to port stages and anything else, feel free to do a pull request, but some rules apply.

1: Follow the same name pattern as the other files in example_mods.

2: Do NOT touch any files outside the example_mods folder, you don't need to do anything outside this folder.

## "I can make/port more options to configure!!"

Anything that allows you to customize your gameplay experience more is welcome. 

Same rule apply here though, if you need to add/edit asset files, do it INSIDE THE EXAMPLE_MODS FOLDER!

# Friday Night Funkin' - Psych Engine Mod Collection

## What is this mod?
This mod ports several mods into one single FNF.exe.

Also contains songs ported from **_osu!mania_**, handpicked by me.

Other features are:
 * B-Sides songs/texture recolours without replacing the original ones.
 * Renamed **accuracy ratings** to crush your dreams and tell you the truth about your shitty 80% accuracy.
 * Tighter hit-windows on everything below Sick. Getting _good/bad/shit/miss_ is now much easier.
 * Added **Insane** and **Expert** difficulty options. 
 * Recharting of some _poorly_ done charts, example: VS Tabi - Last Chance (Hard difficulty)
 * B-Sides songs without replacing the original ones.



## "Songs doesn't have the right characters/stage applied!"
    To be completely honest, I've only bothered fixing this on Hard and above. 
    
    You'll have to do it manually for now or wait until I'm not lazy.

## "Why is there stages or some mechanics missing?"
    Won't be bothering porting stages or note mechanics due to messy source code on the original mods, I'm also terrible at Lua. 

    Plus that gives you a reason not to solely use this build for all your mods but instead use this as a practice build or "no bullshit build".

## "I can port stages and notes for you!!"

    If you want to port stages and anything else, feel free to do a pull request, but some rules apply.

      1: Follow the same name pattern as the other files in example_mods.

      2: Do NOT touch any files outside the example_mods folder, you don't need to do anything outside this folder.

## "I can make/port more options to configure!!"

    Anything that allows you to customize your gameplay experience more is welcome. 

    Same rule apply here though, if you need to add/edit asset files, do it INSIDE THE EXAMPLE_MODS FOLDER!

Drag and drop characters folders here.
Each folder needs to contain:

- Character.hx: Character code
- Character.json: Character JSON file (optional, if using character json)
- spritesheet.png & spritesheet.xml: The Sparrow Atlas spritesheet of your character
- icon.png: An 150x150 grid containing all of the character's icons

You can use the Toolbox's Character Editor to automatically create these files.

So you may be wondering, why the hell is stupidmad the opponett? why is the stage normal? why is bf missing? why is half of the song NOT charted?

To answer these, i'll list them so yahj:

1. The reason why StupidMad is the opponett is cuz he is a PLACEHOLDER for the actual character ( haven't made the FLA )

2. The reason why the stage is normal is cuz i'm working on it, so its a PLACEHOLDER

3. The reason why Boyfriend is missing is cuz he is in PIXEL form and his .xml file isn't working and i'm trying to fix it ( note this ENTIRE song is TV / PIXEL related, so gf will be removed in a upcoming update ).

4. The reason why half of the song is NOT charted is cuz i got tired, i literally worked on the fucking .flp for 2 hours straight, FUCK. If you wanna make your own fanchart, that's fine for me

YES, THIS WILL BE REMOVED IN FUTURE UPDATES

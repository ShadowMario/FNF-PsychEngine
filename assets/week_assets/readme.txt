This is where you should put your week directories for images, sounds and music (not to confuse with "songs").

Examples:
assets/week_assets/week1/
assets/week_assets/weekpsychic/
assets/week_assets/skarlet/

Once compiled, the folders will be moved to assets/ and will look like this:
assets/week1/
assets/weekpsychic/
assets/skarlet/

Check assets/base_game/week7/ for a good example of the file structure
